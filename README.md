# EquipMeUp
⚠️ This project is currently under active development. Things might break. Feel free to check the open issues & create new ones.

## How it started
There was a huge snowstorm in Canada, with about 30cm of heavy snow, overnight. With a 200ft driveway and a shovel, I began to work away at the piles and piles of snow I needed to push. About an hour into the shovelling, I am 1/3 or 1/2 complete. 

Then, I hear my neighbour come to my rescue asking me if I wanted to borrow a snowblower. I graciously said yes. Prior to this, my neighbour and I didn't speak much. 

The idea came to me when I realized that I wish every community could have their own set of tools to borrow / lend. How often do you really need a snowblower? 3-5 times a year? It may be more useful to some to rent/borrow than to spend the 700 - $1000 and buy/maintain one themselves. 


## Optimize Asset Utilization
Users who own equipment that is not being used can lend it out on the platform, turning an idle asset into a source of income. By lending their equipment, users can generate passive income from the rental fees borrowers pay, which can be used to offset the cost of the equipment or fund other investments.

By lending out their idle equipment, users can diversify their income streams and reduce their reliance on a single source of revenue. This can help mitigate financial risks and create a more stable financial situation for individuals and businesses.


## Flexibility for Borrowers
Borrowers can access a wide range of equipment without having to purchase or maintain it themselves, which can help them save on costs and adapt quickly to changing market conditions or project requirements. This increased flexibility can be particularly beneficial for small businesses, freelancers, or individuals who may not have the resources to invest in expensive equipment upfront.

## Network Effect
As more users join the platform and contribute their idle assets, the overall value of the network increases. This can lead to a more extensive selection of equipment, better pricing, and improved matching between lenders and borrowers, ultimately benefiting all participants in the ecosystem.

## Summary 
Overall, EquipMeUp can create new economic opportunities, promote better resource utilization, and contribute to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly economy. Users can benefit from the additional income, increased flexibility, and enhanced financial stability that result from participating in such a platform.

### AMM for Real Assets

Here's a suggested formula for determining the interest rate, i, paid to liquidity providers:

`i = (a * D + b * L + c * R + d * T) / N`

Where:

`D` is the demand factor, representing the difference between buy and sell orders for the asset. You can calculate this by taking the ratio of buy orders to sell orders over a specific time period. A higher value of D indicates stronger demand and would result in a higher interest rate.
`L` is the liquidity factor, representing the liquidity of the specific asset in the market. You can calculate this by taking the ratio of the asset's trading volume to its market capitalization. A higher value of L indicates greater liquidity and would result in a lower interest rate.
`R` is the risk factor, representing the risk associated with the specific asset. You can calculate this by considering factors like the volatility of the asset price, the credit risk of the issuer, and the risk of default. A higher value of R indicates a higher risk and would result in a higher interest rate.
`T` is the time factor, representing the duration for which the liquidity is provided. Longer durations might be associated with a higher interest rate to compensate for the additional risks of locking up the funds for a longer period.
`N` is a normalization factor to ensure that the interest rate stays within a reasonable range. You can determine N empirically by analyzing historical interest rates and adjusting the value to achieve a desired interest rate range.
`a, b, c, and d` are weights assigned to each factor. These weights determine the relative importance of each factor in calculating the interest rate. You can adjust these weights to better match the specific market dynamics of the assets you're working with.

To implement this formula, you can track the relevant data for each asset and update the interest rate periodically, e.g., daily or weekly, based on the changes in demand, liquidity, risk, and time factors.
