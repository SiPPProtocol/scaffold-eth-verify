# This is a template for the environment variables
# To use this template, copy this file, rename it .env, and fill in the values

# Default values are stored in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts`, so developers can start hacking and prototyping without worrying about their API Keys, but we recommend getting your own API Keys for Production-Grade Apps
# To access the values stored in this .env file you can use: process.env.VARIABLENAME
